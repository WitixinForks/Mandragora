Ever wanted that that your crops scream at you when you farm them? That dream comes now true with Mandragora!
Every time you break a crop, there is a small change you accidentally pull out a Mandragora as well, causing it to scream and possibly blind you.
Mandragora's can be used to make potions of Blindness, or to scare your friends by letting them scream while you hold them.

Blindness also now properly applies to mobs, so you can used it to make a quick getaway (as long as you don't stay to close to them)!
